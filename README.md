Keywords: 
Bayes theorem, probabilistic models, probabilistic programming, probability distributions, Bayesian inference, decision-making, uncertainty.

Definition: 
Bayesian programming (or probabilistic programming) is a method to specify probabilistic models, run bayesian inference and solve problems even when little information is available. It help to reason with incomplete and uncertain information.
